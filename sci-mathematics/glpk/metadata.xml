  The GNU Linear Programming Kit package is intended for solving
  large-scale linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming
  (MIP), and other related problems. It is a set of routines written
  in ANSI C and organized in the form of a callable library. 
  GLPK supports the GNU MathProg language, which is a subset of the
  AMPL language.  The GLPK package includes the following main
  components: 
  * Revised simplex method. 
  * Primal-dual interior point method. 
  * Branch-and-bound method. 
  * Translator for GNU MathProg. 
  * Application program interface (API). 
  * Stand-alone LP/MIP solver.
