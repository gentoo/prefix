  GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor—and more. At its core
  is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language
  with extensions to support text editing. The features of GNU Emacs include:
   * Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a wide
     variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.
   * Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new users.
   * Support for many languages and their scripts, including all the European
     "Latin" scripts, Russian, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Thai,
     Vietnamese, Lao, Ethiopian, and some Indian scripts.
   * Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical customization
     interface.
   * A large number of extensions that add other functionality, including a
     project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface, calendar, and
     more. Many of these extensions are distributed with GNU Emacs; others are
     available separately.
