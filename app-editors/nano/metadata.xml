GNU nano - an enhanced clone of the Pico text editor.

The nano project was started because of a few "problems" with the
wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.

First and foremost is its license: the Pine suite does not use the
GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on
redistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included with
many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like goto line
number or search and replace) were unavailable until recently or
require a command line flag.  Yuck.

nano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of
Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and
perhaps providing other extra functionality.
