  The Fastest Fourier Transform in the West is a C subroutine library
  for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in one or more
  dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of arbitrary input
  size. It is becoming the FFT library of choice for most
  applications. Benchmarks, performed on a variety of platforms, show
  that FFTW's performance is typically superior to that of other
  publicly available FFT software.

  <flag name='float'>Link default library to single precision instead of
    double (symlinks only and fftw-2.1)</flag>
  <flag name='openmp'>Build support for the OpenMP parallel
    computing library. Needs OpenMP capable compiler (e.g. gcc >= 4.2)</flag>
