# $Id$

# This file is used for rsync generation on the master rsync mirror. Once a
# directory is moved to gentoo-x86 repository and it should be included in the
# rync checkout, then add an entry here. You can add a subdirectory or the whole
# category. You need to remove the directory from svn once it is checked into
# CVS (gentoo-x86)
#
# Examples:
# profiles
# xfce-base/xfce4-meta
# xfce-extra
#
# Keep this file sorted alphabetically. This file will additionally be used to
# monitor our progress and see what we have left to "move over"

# do NOT mess with these, without these the tree is rendered useless
