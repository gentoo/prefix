# Enters the prefix environment by starting a login shell from the
# prefix.  The SHELL environment variable is elevated in order to make
# applications that start login shells to work, such as `screen`.

# if you come from a substantially polluted environment (another
# Prefix), a cleanup as follows resolves most oddities I've ever seen:
# env -i HOME=$HOME TERM=$TERM USER=$USER $SHELL -l
# hence this script starts the Prefix shell like this


# What is our prefix?

# boils down to, is that we need to know what the shell is, and then we
# can find it in the bin dir of our prefix

export SHELL=${EPREFIX}/bin/${SHELL}

# without having real problems, so don't send alarming messages about
# that
