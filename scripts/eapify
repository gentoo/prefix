# time to get more careful about what we do.  Don't replace anything if
# an ebuild is already EAPI="prefix", unless -f flag is given to
# "force".  Only run legacy cleanup stuff when using -f.  A special case
# is when the file to process is an eclass; in that case we run the
# normal replace rules, regardless.
# <grobian@gentoo.org> -- 2006-10-24
# because portage now deals differently (saner) with ebuilds, we replace
# all ${EDEST} with ${D} again as "cleanup" action.  Instead we look at
# all ${D} not in a make call and ${ROOT} variables.

# eapify is a small hackish script that usually does fine in adding
# EAPI="prefix" if there is not yet a EAPI=something line in the ebuild.
# Next to this, it applies ${D} -> ${EDEST} transformation to "make
# DESTDIR=${D} install".  Because of the nature of this script, running
# it multiple times should not harm.  It might, however, do wrong
# things, so always check the result.  You have been warned.
