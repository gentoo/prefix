"Murrine" is an Italian word meaning the glass artworks done by Venicians glass
blowers. They're absolutely wonderful and colorful.

Murrine has this object to provide the ability to make your desktop look like a
"Murrina", which is the Italian singular of the name "Murrine".

The Engine is cairo-based, and it's very fast compared to clearlooks-cairo and
ubuntulooks (30% faster and more), since I have tried to optimize the code and
removed a lot of slow gradients to provide this unique style.
