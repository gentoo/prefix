		Cook is a tool for constructing files. It is given a set of files to
		create, and recipes of how to create them. In any non-trivial program
		there will be prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to
		creating any file, such as include files. Cook provides a mechanism to
		define these.
 		
		When a program is being developed or maintained, the programmer will
		typically change one file of several which comprise the program. Cook
		examines the last-modified times of the files to see when the
		prerequisites of a file have changed, implying that the file needs to be
		recreated as it is logically out of date.
 
		Cook also provides a facility for implicit recipes, allowing users to
		specify how to form a file with a given suffix from a file with a
		different suffix. For example, to create filename.o from filename.c
