  12 Nov 2006; Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org>
  -portage-2.1.20.4942.ebuild, +portage-2.1.20.5016.ebuild:
  New snapshot from main-line, plus additional SVN support, such that

  16 Oct 2006; Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  New release 4721 which is based on a complete merge of the trunk code.

  11 Oct 2006; Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Since the bootstrap script now uses 4497, removed 4415.  Bumped 4497
  to -r6, to include root_slash patch, such that original ebuilds and
  eclasses work without modifying ${ROOT} handling.

  08 Oct 2006; Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> ChangeLog:
  Rewrote QA patch from Matt, to actually work and die on double prefixed
  files. Added QA check for files installed outside the prefix, which also
  dies if it finds files.  Bumping to -r5 to force everyone using the
  new QA checks for better feedback on problem packages in the tree.
