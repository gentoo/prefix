+    # Prefix hack: historically a revision starting with 0 was an
+    # 'inter-revision', which means that it is possible to create
+    # revisions on revisions.  An example is -r01.1 which is the
+    # first revision of -r1.  Note that a period (.) is used to
+    # separate the real revision and the secondary revision number.
+    # In the current state, the leading 0 is no longer used, and
+    # versions just can have a dot, which means the version is an
+    # inter-revision.
+    # This trick is in use to allow revision bumps in ebuilds synced
+    # from the main tree for Prefix changes, while still staying in
+    # the main tree versioning scheme.  As such it can be used in
+    # any other overlay where ebuilds from the another tree are
+    # shadowed.
